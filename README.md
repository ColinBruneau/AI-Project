# AI-Project
Artificial Intelligence Framework developped at Creajeux by Colin Bruneau

This project started in 2015 as a way to centralize the development of the AI engine made during the course AI that I gave to 3rd year students. 
Then it got bigger with the integration of DirectX as base graphics engine. 
It also allows me to test a Git repositery.
